# ckeditor5-image-via-url
Embed Image via Url is currently unsupported by Ckeditor 5 default. That's why i do this.

Everything that could make your site partial in-secure is not recommended by Ckeditor 5.
Therefore Embed Image via Url feature suffer the same destiny.

However if you like this feature so bad as i do, this might help.

This version only works on @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic, but you can take the idea to do whatever you want.

Remember to add a little tweak in _rwd.css, detailed in the tutorial text file.

Enjoy!
